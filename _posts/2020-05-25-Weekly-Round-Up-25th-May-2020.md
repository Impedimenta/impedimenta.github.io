From the release notes,

> Suitcase can now be called from a script in a similar way to bash or python. Just start you script with this hash-bang,

> #! /usr/local/bin/Suitcase interpreter
> ```
>
> All arguments need to be on a single line and it supports comments using #.
> 
> Here is the YouTube-DL Example using interpreter mode,
> 
> ```bash
> #! /usr/local/bin/Suitcase interpreter
> 
> # Drag and drop URLs to the floating window
> # and download the embedded video stream using
> # `youtube-dl`. 
> 
> # Application 
> --name="Download YouTube" 
> --window-floating # The window will be infront of all others
> 
> # Dropped URL Control
> --control-type="dropped-urls-label" 
> --control-title="## Drop Your URLs Here! ##"
