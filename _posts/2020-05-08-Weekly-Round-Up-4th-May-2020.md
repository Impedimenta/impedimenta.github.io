This last week I created some examples and demos of how to use Suitcase, links below. Iâ€™ve had some very positive feedback but also people not realising it was released (alpha) and you can [download it form the GitHub page](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/releases/latest/download/Suitcase.dmg).

## Examples & Demos

- A PCalc rip-off, inspired by a dream I had about James Thomson, ([tweet](https://twitter.com/rjstelling/status/1257231568466251776)) ([video](https://vimeo.com/415716551))

- YouTube DL demo, a homage to [Casey Liss'](https://twitter.com/caseyliss) short lived YouTube career ([tweet](https://twitter.com/SuitcaseCLI/status/1258149597970608129)) ([video](https://vimeo.com/415711426))

- Hexdump, a Suitcase wrapper around [`hexdump`](x-man-page://hexdump) this is my favourite so far. ([tweet](https://twitter.com/SuitcaseCLI/status/1258051954477010949)) ([video](https://vimeo.com/415711815))

I also posted a [collection of all the demo videos on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7102180).
