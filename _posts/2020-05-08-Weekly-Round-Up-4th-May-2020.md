This seems more of an appropriate place to post a Suitcase update

This last week I created some examples and demos of how to use Suitcase, links below. Iâ€™ve had some very positive feedback but also people not realising it was released (alpha) and you can download it form the GitHub page.

Examples & Demos

A PCalc rip-off, inspired by a dream I had about James Thomson, (tweet) (video)
YouTube DL demo, a homage to Cassey Liss short lived YouTube career (tweet) (video)
Hexdump, a Suitcase wrapper around hexdump this is my favourite so far. (tweet) (video)

I also posted a collection of all the demo videos on Vimeo.
