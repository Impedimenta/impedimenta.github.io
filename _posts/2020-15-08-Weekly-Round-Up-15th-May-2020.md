This week the [third alpha build was released](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha-3). This release consentrated on filling holes in functionality to allow for better interface designs.

## Alpha 3 Highlights

- `--dividers`, adds a visual dividing line either vertically or horizontally depending on its context.  

- `--spacers`, adds a spacer that expands to fill the space, allows for controls to be left or right aligned.  

- `text-mono`, this new control type acts the same as the `text` type. The only difference is the font used in mono-spaced. This is useful when displaying ASCII charts and tables.

## Information, Doumentation and Feedback

I've slowly been adding places where you can send feedback and trying to make it easy to find examples and documintation. If you think anything is missing please [open an issue](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/issues).

## Open Source Roadmap

I [wrote this](https://impedimenta.github.io/2020/05/11/Open-Source-Roadmap.html) on 11th May, 2020,

> Iâ€™m not going to announce a date, but my aim is to release the code by end of 2020. There is little point releasing the current alpha quality code, its hacky and inconstant. If I am to steward this project for the foreseeable future it needs a solid foundation, a plan and process.
