One of the very first [issues opened on Suitcase](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/issues/4) was a polite enquiry as to the whareabouts of the source code.

It's been a busy week, but I wanted to publicly make a commitment to releasing the code. 

## When

Iâ€™m not going to announce a date, but my aim is to release the code by end of 2020. There is little point releasing the current alpha quality code, its hacky and inconstant. If I am to steward this project for the foreseeable future it needs a solid foundation, a plan and process.

## How

The code will most likely be released under the [Apachie 2.0 licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/). I'm open to a discussion of the pros and cons, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/issues).

## Contact

If you'd like to discuss this further, fee free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Impedimenta/Suitcase/issues) for public discussion or find [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rjstelling) where the DM's are open.
